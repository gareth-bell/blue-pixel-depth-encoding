# blue-pixel-depth-encoding
The Great Wall Motors project may require a system that can convert a single LVDS output into a mono + colour MLD image. If this is the case it may be possible to encode the depth map for the image somehow in the blue pixels. Two approaches are apparent: (a) In the case that we can use a binary depth map, encode using the least significant bit of each blue pixel (b) In the case we need a full 8 bit depth map, encode the depth map using every second pixel
